# CapstoneProject

RentShare is an application that allows users to rent belongings of any kind from other users. It bridges the gap between individuals who have items they are willing to rent out and those who need access to items for a short period while providing an avenue for users to make a small income from the belongings they rent out. 
Features included are:
- MySQL database integration
- React/Javascript front end
- Express/NodeJS backend
- Socket.io for messaging

# Run the project:

Create a MySQL database:
- create local instance localhost:3306
- create a schema called RentShareDB
